# Classroom VR For Heavy Civil Operations
A project for Dr. Joseph Louis at Oregon State University, code made by Matthew Attebery, Sam Schneider, D Wilson, Alex Yu

## Project Purpose
This project's purpose was to setup an easy to deploy system for Dr. Louis to host Unity3D scenes for his classroom lectures. In the past, Dr. Louis has had example problems in his class as simple textual descriptions. Since Dr. Louis teaches in the school of Construction and Civil Engineering, most of his problems in class are extremely physical in nature, describing the motion of heavy machinery and the like. Dr. Louis wanted a simple and easy to use interface to let his students learn these problems not from a slideshow, but from something they could hold in their hand. That is why our project focuses on serving Unity3D scenes on a variety of platforms. Dr. Louis has also worked with a number of other teams to generate scenes for his examples.

##Competing products
There seems to be no competing products for teaching at this scale. A variety of platforms could be used to create graphics for his classes, but there are currently no competing products that allow him to generate and host these graphics in a way that is accessible on desktop and mobile devices. 

##Help
Due to the nature of the product, it was determined that having the user manual and documentation on a Google Doc would be the best long-term solution. [The documentation is hosted here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-X64OJF1tYWViSAIz27k3BeRKXiG9s4M-N_R0QHtAFY/edit?usp=sharing)

##How to run

You can access our scenes by using the Unity editor. Additionally, PHP scripts are included, but these are made to work on his server, so YMMV.
